Abstract:
The model automatically generates a variety of contextually relevant recipes by utlizing machine learning and deep learning approaches. By utilizing a neural network thathas been trained, the model is able to identify complex patterns and relationships found in large recipe datasets. 
This enables the model to generate new and coherent recipes based on input criteria(image), aiding in the automated process of recipe generation. The model also provides information about allergens and suggests alternatives to allergens.

Statement of the problem:
The challenge at hand is that conventional meal planning techniques often come up short in addressing the myriad of nutritional needs and preferences that individuals possess. Generic meal plans fail to consider important factors such as dietary limitations,
allergies, cultural preferences, and specific health objectives. This oversight leads to user dissatisfaction,issues with adherence, and less-than-optimal nutritional outcomes. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the development of a cutting-edge Personalized Meal Plan Generator to tackle these challenges
head-on and deliver tailor-made meal plans that perfectly align with each user’s unique dietary profile. In today’s increasingly diverse and health conscious society, one-size-fits-all approaches to meal planning are no longer sufficient. Individuals deserve
a more personalized and inclusive solution that takes into account their distinct culinary requirements and dietary restrictions. The Personalized Meal Plan Generator is poised to bridge this gap by leveraging advanced data-driven algorithms and machine learning techniques. 
It empowers users to embark on a culinary journey that caters to their precise dietary needs and aspirations, fostering not only satisfaction but also improved adherence to healthy eating practices. By embracing this innovative solution, individuals
can look forward to receiving meal recommendations that are thoughtfully curated to match their specific dietary parameters. This forward-looking approach not only addresses the limitations of traditional meal planning methods but also promotes a deeper connection between individuals and their nutritional goals.
In essence, the Personalized Meal Plan Generator is set to redefine the way we approach meal planning, making it a more individualized, enjoyable, and effective endeavor for all
